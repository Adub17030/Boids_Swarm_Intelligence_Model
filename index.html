                            Developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, Boids is an
                            artificial life program that simulates the flocking
                            behavior of birds. The name “boid” itself refers to
                            a shortened version of “bird-oid object”. Instead of
                            controlling the interaction of the entire flock or
                            swarm of birds, the Boids simulation only specifies
                            the behavior of each individual bird with a few
                            simple rules. The key aspect regarding this
                            intelligence model is that the highly complex
                            behavior of a multi-agent system can be explained by
                            the simple interaction of many independent agents
                            all working with incomplete information. With this
                            aspect, Boids is able to effectively showcase
                            emergent behavior in swarm systems, and by
                            understanding the model foundation that creates this
                            behavior, we can in turn gain the ability to direct
                            and coordinate a swarm system by tuning its
                            low-level ruleset. The model consists of a swarm of
                            agents that each obeys three simple rules:
                        </p>
                        <li>
                            Alignment: Each boid steers to match the average
                            velocity of nearby boids
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Coherence: Each boid steers to move to the average
                            position of nearby boids
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Separation: Each boid steers to avoid running into
                            other boids
                        </li>
                        <br />

                            The simulation is preset to the most ideal settings
                            for the alignment, cohesion, and separation values
                            on a swarm of 200 boids. The level of alignment,
                            cohesion, and separation can all be controlled with
                            the appropriate sliders. We can simulate any number
                            of boids, however, a number is greater than 300
                            boids will slow the simulation down. This simulation
                            also allows us to introduce obstacles to this
                            multi-agent environment. By clicking on the” enable
                            obstacle drawing” checkbox, you can draw obstacles
                            into the simulation by clicking and dragging your
                            mouse over the black canvas. There are three modes
                            of interaction that we can set:
                        </p>
                        <li>Avoid: The boids will avoid the obstacle</li>
                        <li>Collect: The boids will collect around</li>
                        <li>
                            Coverage: The boids will position themselves to
                            cover the obstacle in a stable manner
                        </li>

                        <h3>
                            Now you can use this information to control the
                            behavior of a swarm of boids!
